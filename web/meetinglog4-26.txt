4/26 Meeting

We have gotten Leaf to leaf communication working! This took a while today but we consolodated a lot of the C tasks and changed some our flag variable logic. 
Messages now successfully broadcast throughout the mesh network from any node. Leaf node messages will propogate to the root, who then sends this throughout the routing table.
Root messages send messages to all children in their routing table etc. We have taken a video for submission for our Embedded final project. We may use this video in our 
PowerPoint Presentation for CS3992.
