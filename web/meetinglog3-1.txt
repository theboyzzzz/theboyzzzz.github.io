3/1 Meeting

In today's meeting, we worked on our initial proposal documentation. We have revised the abstract a little more and flushed out the Introduction. Everyone is responsible now for finishing up the Method's sections on the final proposal. We will reconvene and do a final read through before the paper is due.
