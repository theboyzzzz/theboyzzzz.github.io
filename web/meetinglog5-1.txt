5/1 Meeting

After our presentation today, which went pretty well, we did a final read through of our paper. Out loud the paper sounded good. We have made a lot of revisions as we hear things.
We are revising over the final sections tonight on Discord and Stephan will submit. Excellent Semester Everyone! We will take one month off and then start working on our Senior Project again.
